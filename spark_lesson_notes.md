# Spark

> Matthew Brenned | Data Science & Engineering Consultant

## INTRO

- Big Data
  - Volume, velocity, variety, veracity
  - Treated differently? More than one machine / core / distributed processing
  - Challenges?
  - Examples - Netflix, 
- High level overview of capabilities

- Unified

## Architecture

- MLLib - machine learning
- Streaming - real-time analytcs
- SQL - interactive queries
- GraphX - Graph database

- R
- Python
- Scala - native language
- Jave

![Spark Ecosystem](ecosystem.png)

- Parquet files
  - Not human readable
  - Partitions where data split and stored efficiently

![CLuster Managers](cluster_managers.png)


- Data is physically partitioned

### JOB

- Parallel computation consisting of multiple tasks in response to actions
### STAGE

- Each job divided in smaller set of tasks in stages
### TASK

- Individual action
## DataFrames

![Structured APIs](apis.png)

- Immutable
- Distributed tables
- Fastest structures to perform operations

![DAG](dag.png)

![Transform](transform_act.png)

- Wide vs narrow
- Do partitions need to interact or can they be executed
